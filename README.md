## ⭐ Featured Portfolio Projects
These projects represent my **strongest, end-to-end analytics work**.

### 🫁 Smoking-Related Health Risk Analysis (Power BI + SQL)
**Healthcare analytics project analyzing the systemic impact of smoking across vital organs**

- Performed SQL-based risk analysis across lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, and cardiovascular indicators
- Analyzed smoking duration, daily intake, age, and demographic risk patterns

**Key Insight:**  
Smoking-related health risk is **systemic rather than isolated**, with higher damage rates strongly associated with longer smoking duration, higher daily intake, and elevated cardiovascular risk — especially in older age groups.
